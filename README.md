# Description

The TEMPEST engine  
As of now, this is a 1 man project  
Big props to CMK for the 0x88 engine, the logic in his engine served as the backbone of this project  
This code is just a rough adaptation from the original source code (written in C), to Python code + enhancements

# Implementation

Implemented in Python 3.8

# How to Run

Run "tempest.py" with Pypy  
Essentially just run this with a faster implementation of Python
