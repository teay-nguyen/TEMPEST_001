# Description

The TEMPEST engine  
As of now, this is a 1 man project  
Big props to CMK for the 0x88 engine, the logic in his engine served as the backbone of this project  
This code is just a rough adaptation from the original source code (written in C), to Python code + enhancements

# Implementation

Implemented in Python 3.8

# Notes

Run this engine with Pypy or compile it with Cython  
Essentially just run this with a faster implementation of Python
