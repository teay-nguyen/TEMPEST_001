    - 0x88 board representation
    - I have not decided what kind of search algorithm to use yet, but I'm more inclined into choosing AlphaBeta or Monte-Carlo
    - Zobrist Hashing and Transposition Tables (I'm not sure if this is necessary in Monte-Carlo search)
    - Some other search pruning techniques

                                 [LANGUAGE: PYTHON 3.8.9, VERSION: v1.0]

    - I actually document or keep my older implementations of this, so you can check it out and probably send a PR if you want
    - I put the first version in the old trash implementation folder because it is indeed trash and doesn't work anyway
    - My old version was largely imcompatible with Pypy because Pypy somehow runs incredibly slow with my old version, maybe its because of pygame or just my trash coding skills
